# Pneumonia_Detection
Classification of Pneumonia using x-ray images 

## Overview
"Chest-X-Ray-Pneumonia_Detection" is a project leveraging chest X-ray images to automate pneumonia detection, enhancing medical diagnostics. It likely involves image processing or deep learning techniques for accurate identification of pneumonia in a quick and efficient manner.

## What is Pneumonia?
Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lungs, affecting air sacs (alveoli). Symptoms include cough, chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing. It's commonly caused by viral or bacterial infections, sometimes by other factors. Risk factors include lung conditions, diabetes, smoking history, and weakened immunity. Diagnosis involves symptoms, physical exams, chest X-rays, blood tests, and sputum culture. Types include community-acquired, hospital-acquired, or healthcare-associated pneumonia.

## Content
The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).

Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care.

## Deep Learning Concepts and Tools
### 1. CNN

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model designed for processing and analyzing visual data, such as images. CNNs use convolutional layers to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. The network's architecture enables it to recognize patterns, shapes, and objects within the images, making CNNs well-suited for tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

### 2. Inception v3

Inception v3 is a powerful neural network created by Google for recognizing and classifying images. It's part of the Inception model family and stands out for its deep structure and specialized modules, using techniques like factorized convolutions and batch normalization to boost training effectiveness. Widely applied in computer vision, it excels at tasks like image classification.

### 3. VIT

"ViT" stands for "Vision Transformer," a smart computer system that uses a special technique to understand and recognize images. It breaks down pictures into smaller pieces, processes them in a unique way, and is really good at tasks like figuring out what's in a photo.
